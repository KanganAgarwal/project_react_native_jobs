# React Native Jobs App

This is a React Native application built using Expo that allows users to search for job listings. The app utilizes the JSearch API to fetch job data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/KanganAgarwal/project_react_native_jobs.git


2. Install project dependencies:

cd project_react_native_jobs
npm install


3. Get Your API Key:

Visit [JSearch API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch) to get your own API key.

4. Configure API Key:

create the `.env.local` file located in the project's root directory. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual JSearch API key.


 API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

## Running the App

Once you've set up your API key, you can start the app using Expo CLI:

npx expo start

This will start the development server and provide you with a QR code. You can scan this code using the Expo Go app on your mobile device to see the app in action.
